# Modifying the filesystem for use with single user mode.
#### If you have not yet checked out and built the single user mode fork of the nor repo please do so before doing the following steps.

`cd` into the `resources/binaries` folder. <br>
Run `sudo cp -rv * {path to your mounted image}/` <br>
Convert the image into the nand folder as instructed at the bottom of Changes.md <br>
Now next time you boot the emulator you will be greated with a single user prompt. <br>
<b>Happy Hacking! ~ Zoe</b>
