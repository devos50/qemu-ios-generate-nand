# This file contains the table of known CPU names.
#
# Architecture names are formed as a combination of the system name
# (from ostable) and CPU name (from this table).  A list of architecture
# names in the Debian ‘sid’ distribution can be found in the archtable
# file.
#
# Column 1 is the Debian name for the CPU, used to form the architecture
# name.
# Column 2 is the GNU name for the CPU, used to output build and host
# targets in ‘dpkg-architecture’.
# Column 3 is an extended regular expression used to match against the
# CPU part of the output of the GNU config.guess script.
#
# <Debian name>	<GNU name>	<config.guess regex>
